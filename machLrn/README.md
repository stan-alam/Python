Machine learning is eating the software world, and now deep learning is
extending machine learning. Understand and work at the cutting edge of
machine learning, neural networks, and deep learning with this second edition
of Sebastian Raschka’s bestselling book, Python Machine Learning. Thoroughly
updated using the latest Python open source libraries, this book offers the
practical knowledge and techniques you need to create and contribute to machine
learning, deep learning, and modern data analysis.

Fully extended and modernized, Python Machine Learning Second Edition now
includes the popular TensorFlow deep learning library. The scikit-learn code
has also been fully updated to include recent improvements and additions to
this versatile machine learning library.

Sebastian Raschka and Vahid Mirjalili’s unique insight and expertise introduce
you to machine learning and deep learning algorithms from scratch, and show
you how to apply them to practical industry challenges using realistic and
interesting examples. By the end of the book, you’ll be ready to meet the
new data analysis opportunities in today’s world.

If you’ve read the first edition of this book, you’ll be delighted to find a
new balance of classical ideas and modern insights into machine learning.
Every chapter has been critically updated, and there are new chapters on
key technologies. You’ll be able to learn and work with TensorFlow more
