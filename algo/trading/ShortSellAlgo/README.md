If you are in the long/short business, learning how to sell short is not a choice. Short selling is the key to raising assets when the markets are down. This book will help you demystify and rehabilitate the short-selling craft, providing Python source code to construct a robust long/short portfolio. It explains everything you have ever read about short selling from a long-only perspective.

This book will take you on a journey from an idea (“buy bullish stocks, sell bearish ones”) to becoming part of the elite club of long/short hedge fund algorithmic traders. You’ll explore key concepts such as trading psychology, trading edge, regime definition, signal processing, position sizing, risk management, and asset allocation, one obstacle at a time. Along the way, you’ll will discover simple methods to consistently generate investment ideas, and consider variables that impact returns, volatility, and overall attractiveness of returns.

By the end of this book, you’ll not only become familiar with some of the most sophisticated concepts in capital markets, but also have Python source code to construct a long/short product that investors are bound to find attractive.
