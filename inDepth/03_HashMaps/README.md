**In Depth - Hash Maps**

  * Dictionaries, Sets, and Related Data Structures

  * in-depth look at Python dictionaries.

  *  Dictionaries are ubiquitous in Python. Classes are essentially dictionaries, modules are dictionaries, namespaces are dictionaries, sets are dictionaries and many more.

  * associative arrays and how they can be implemented using hash maps

  * hash functions and how we can leverage them for our own custom classes

  * Python dictionaries and sets and the various operations we can perform with them

   * specialized dictionary structures such as OrderedDict and how it relates to the built-in Python3.6+ dict

Python’s implementation of multi-sets, the Counter class

the ChainMap class

create custom dictionaries by inheriting from the UserDict class

serialize and deserialize dictionaries to JSON

use schemas in custom JSON deserialization

introduction libraries such as JSONSchema, Marshmallow, PyYaml and Serpy
 you should also have an in-depth understanding of the following topics:

functions and functional programming (recursion, *args, **kwargs, zip, map, sorted, any, all, etc)
lambdas, closures and decorators (including standard decorators such as @singledispatch, @wraps, etc)

iterables, iterators, generators and context managers

named tuples

variable scopes and namespaces (globals, locals, etc)

you need to install 3rd party libraries, so you need to be comfortable with doing this using the tool of your choice (e.g. pip, conda, etc)
